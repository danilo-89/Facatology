					<h2>Etymology</h2>
					<p>
						The origin of the English word 'cat', Old English catt, is thought
						to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the
						beginning of the 6th century.[18] It was suggested that the word
						'cattus' is derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau,
						"tomcat", or its feminine form suffixed with -t.[19] The Late Latin
						word is also thought to be derived from Afro-Asiatic languages.[20]
						The Nubian word kaddîska "wildcat" and Nobiin kadīs are possible
						sources or cognates.[21] The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic
						قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ. It is "equally likely that the forms might
						derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence
						to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic".[22] The word may be derived from
						Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed
						from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gáđfi, "female stoat", and Hungarian
						hölgy, "stoat"; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, "female (of a furred
						animal)".[23]

					<h2>Life span</h2>
					<p>
						To date, reliable information on the lifespans of domestic cats is
						varied and relatively scant.[1] Nevertheless, a number of studies
						have investigated the matter and have come up with noteworthy
						estimates. Estimates of mean lifespan in these studies range between
						13 and 17 years, with a single value in the neighborhood of 15
						years.[2][3][4] At least one study found a median lifespan value of
						14 years and a corresponding interquartile range of 9 to 17
						years.[5] Maximum lifespan has been estimated at values ranging from
						22 to 30 years although there have been claims of cats dying at ages
						greater than 30 years.[1][2][5][6][7][8] According to the 2010
						edition of the Guinness World Records, the oldest cat ever recorded
						was Creme Puff, who died in 2005, aged 38 years, 3 days.[9] Female
						cats have been evidenced to outlive male cats, while neutered cats
						and crossbred cats have been evidenced to outlive entire and
						purebred cats, respectively.[2][5] [5]

A small page in retro / newspaper style.
Initial idea was just creating custom svg frames but as I progressed it seemed cool to make the whole page in this style. -->
